# What

This is a github repo (obviously) made for this project am working on which is a mean voice assistant that will roast the user.

# Why 

The reason am building this is for two main reasons:
* I'm making a video about it find it [**here**](link)
* Learning by doing: I just love learning and the best way to do it is by working on projects 
* Fun: I might sound like a maniac but problem solving is fun 

## Resources 
I am honstly too lazy to format this so i'll leave the links as they are
